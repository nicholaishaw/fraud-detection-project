## Background
Recent data from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) show that consumers lost nearly $8.8 billion to fraud in 2022 ("*New FTC data*," 2023). The FTC received fraud reports from 2.4 million consumers, most of whom were targeted by imposter scams, followed by online shopping scams. These data show that fraudulent transactions impose a massive burden on Americans across the country, so we created a supervised machine learning model to better predict fradulent transactions to aid in the process of detecting and stopping scams. We used a data. To accomplish this goal, we used a dataset from Kaggle that possessed 111,144 credit card transactions that were classified as either fraudulent or not fraudulent (Shenoy, n.d.). The dataset possessed features of each purchase including credit card number, transaction id, gender of card holder, first and last name of card holder, merchant name, transaction category, amount of transaction, geographic information (latitude, longitude, street name, zip code, city, state), date of birth, and time and date of transaction. Using these data, we created two models—a logistic regression and random forest—to predict instances of fraud.
